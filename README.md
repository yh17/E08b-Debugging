# E08b-Debugging

As usual, Fork and Clone this repository.

This exercise is an opportunity for you to debug syntax, interpreter, and other runtime errors in a fairly-complex project. Some of the syntax and concepts represented in this code may seem foreign or advanced, but if you work systematically, you should be able to address the problems in this code.

This exercise was adapted from the excellent platformer tutorial developed by GDQuest. Once you have corrected the problems, I hope this will provide a starting place for your project (if you have been struggling to get started).

I have introduced eight errors (of different types) into the scripts in this project. Your assignment is to find and correct those errors. Some of them are syntax or interpreter errors, which will prevent the program from running at all. Others are runtime or behavioral errors which may require a little more work to find.

The project is associated with a tutorial (both a free and paid version). The free version is in two parts and is available here:
 * [Make Your First 2D Game with Godot: Player and Enemy (beginner tutorial part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk)
 * [Make Your First 2D Game with Godot: Coins, Portals, and Levels (beginner tutorial part 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ziIyx60N6I)

The original source code is available on GitHub, but please only use it as a point of comparison after you have exhausted all other options.

When you have found all eight errors (one of them is on multiple lines), commit your changes, and turn in the URL of your repository on Canvas.
